				<h2>About CheckIn</h2>
				<h3>Why We Exist</h3>
				<p>We believe we are seeing the beginning of profound changes in the way information is shared and distributed.  Beacon technology will soon be a part of our daily lives.  Our service CheckIn is designed to allow organizations of all sizes to stay current with these changes in technology.  Our goal is a simple one. We aim to provide great, user friendly services using cutting edge technology (LE Bluetooth beacons), without breaking anyone’s budget.</p>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>We have developed CheckIn, a beacon-based information sharing service.  CheckIn allows multiple organizations to share and request data under a single customer app.  Currently, there is a gap in the market for user friendly beacon interfaces.  Only large companies with the resources to develop their own interfaces can use beacon technology.  CheckIn enables small organizations, providing them with technology usually reserved for organizations with large bankrolls, while still benefiting larger organizations by providing a cheap alternative to high development and marketing costs.</p>  
				<p>CheckIn provides an appealing and affordable product for any organization interested in using beacon technology.  Having multiple organizations under one app creates an unparalleled ease of use for customers and organizations alike.  With our app, customers can easily connect with all the organizations they interact with, and because the organizations are under one app, they will not have to allocate resources to market the individual beacon services.</p>
				<h3>Potential Business Cases</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Airlines can use CheckIn for passenger check-in at terminal gates.  The airline could request a ticket ID number, and would quickly know how many of their customers are at the terminal gate, and how many are absent.  With this information they could choose to look to fill the plane with other passengers, send out a last call message to thsoe who are late, and if the plane at the gate is small, they could reorganize the passengers for better weight distribution.</li>
					<li>Doctor offices and hospitals could use CheckIn to get rid of the paper and clipboard forms (probably a health hazard), and replace them with our interface. CheckIn stores user information so a customer would only have to fill out the basic information once. This would free up the front desk staff and allow them to work on other tasks and focus on patient satisfaction, improving the efficiency of the workspace.</li>
					<li>Large organizations such as OSU could use this software as a poll device or attendance recorded.  OSU could use CheckIn to determine how many people attended a large event. They could use promotions such as a raffle for those who check in.  This information could be used to determine if the event’s attendance was worth the initial investment, other events could be managed according to the result collected.</li>
					<li>Small retailers could create a rewards system for loyal customers using CheckIn to offer promotions and request feedback. The retailers could create customer profiles based off of the information they request from the customers.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Future Work</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a login menu so the app logs the user into their account on start up</li>
					<li>Allow for unique images to be shown next to the company names when displaying different beacons</li>
					<li>Create an Android app</li>
					<li>Implement a database</li>
					<li>Create a workable interface for clients to create custom lists to push to the app</li>
					<li>Create in house IBeacon with unique UUID</li>
				</ul>

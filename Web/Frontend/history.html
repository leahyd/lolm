				<h2>what is checkin?</h2>
					<p>CheckIn is a service that utilizes three main technologies: a smartphone, a website, and bluetooth beacons. The idea is that we can make smartphones smarter by using small bluetooth beacons that send out signals. We take those signals and use them to allow your customers to CheckIn so you can see who's at your place, and who isn't. It's convenient for medical practices, hospitals, concerts, parties, and all kinds of other events!</p>
					<p>There's a few things though that you'll need and have to do first, party animals, before you can go crazy.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>You need a low energy bluetooth beacon. We recommend <a href="http://estimote.com/#jump-to-products" title="Estimote product information on the Estimote website">Estimote</a>!</li>
						<li>Register on our website as an establishment.</li>
						<li>Put your beacon near a place where all of your users can CheckIn.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>And that's it! Easy, huh?</p>
			
				<h2>how we started</h2>
				<p>CheckIn started off as a competition project for the 2014 Ohio State Hackathon where it won first prize because everyone thought it was super awesome. We like to think it's because of the time, love and care we put in to making this great service available to the world! Thirty-six hours spent in the basement of a library spawned the easy check-in service you have come to know and love. It was made with lots of pizza, coffee, and the occasional Key &amp; Peele video to get us through.</p>
				<p>We are committed towards continually improving our service and we strive to give you guys, our loyal users, the best and easiest experience possible.</p>

				<p><strong>Dan Leahy</strong> - started off in humble beginnings as a small child. From there, he quickly grasped the meaning of life and ascended to become a web developer with a power level over 9000. With the time he cares to spend on assisting mankind, he snipes unsolvable bugs, helps sloths in trouble, and gives advice on the best way to sing in the shower.</p>
				<p><strong>John Maroli</strong> - was a genius from birth and outsmarted Deep Blue in a game of chess when he was only six. He also created a standard model of physics that has no inconsistencies that he is prepared to share with the world, when the world is ready. John spends his spare time implementing a quantum computer that computes in a parallel universe.</p>
				<p><strong>Grant Savage</strong> - mastered the art of the straight face just seconds after he was born. He has since used his talents to thwart terrorist plots around the globe and bring to justice some of the most evil sloth trappers. Grant wants to be a professional professional when he grows up and is amongst the better-looking of men on the planet.</p>
				<p><strong>Thomas Clark</strong> - is a collection of scientific breakthroughs. Some people have claimed to know him, and others only know the legends. We cannot be sure if he truly exists, or if he lives vicariously through the stories we tell of him. One day the world will discover Thomas Clark, and it is said that on that day we will consequently discover many secrets to the universe.</p>
